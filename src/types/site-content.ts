    "Mamalu Kitchen is creating a cooking movement under the slogan #feedingfamilies.",
    "In line with her cooking movement in 2020 she started Eazy Freezy, it is all natural, easy to cook frozen food products for families on the go. Hassle free yumminess without the bad stuff. The products are available online and across Spinneys & Waitrose outlets all over the UAE.",

    "Raised between Lebanon and the UK, Lama has always had a passion for cooking since the age of 4. By shadowing her mother from a young age, she acquired the knowledge of all of the classic Arabic dishes. Her specialty is family food - large, beautiful mouthwatering dishes with a strong Mediterranean influence to be shared amongst friends and family.",
    "Her love of cooking lead her to study in Glion Hotel School, Switzerland and earn a Hospitality & Tourism degree and gain experience with some of the top 5 star luxury hotel groups such as Four Seasons, Rocco Forte and Hyatt hotels in London, Paris and Rome.",
    "Mamalu Kitchen is not Lama's first entrepreneurial venture, she has had over a decade of experience in the fashion industry under her independent private label. She has opened two concept stores in Beirut, Lebanon {Ribbon & Lace and Birdcage} She has also been a part of the prestigious London & Paris Fashion weeks for 7 consecutive years and has extensive experience as a designer for high end clothing brand, Mojo World.",
    "She is also a proud mother of three boys (at one time all 3 of them were under 2 years old) and they have inspired her to launch Mamalu Kitchen less than 4 months after her twins were born.",
