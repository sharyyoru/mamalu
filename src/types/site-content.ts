    "Raised between Lebanon and the UK, Lama has always had a passion for cooking since the age of 4. By shadowing her mother from a young age, she acquired the knowledge of all of the classic Arabic dishes. Her specialty is family food - large, beautiful mouthwatering dishes with a strong Mediterranean influence to be shared amongst friends and family.",
    "Her love of cooking lead her to study in Glion Hotel School, Switzerland and earn a Hospitality & Tourism degree and gain experience with some of the top 5 star luxury hotel groups such as Four Seasons, Rocco Forte and Hyatt hotels in London, Paris and Rome.",
    "Mamalu Kitchen is not Lama's first entrepreneurial venture, she has had over a decade of experience in the fashion industry under her independent private label. She has opened two concept stores in Beirut, Lebanon {Ribbon & Lace and Birdcage} She has also been a part of the prestigious London & Paris Fashion weeks for 7 consecutive years and has extensive experience as a designer for high end clothing brand, Mojo World.",
    "She is also a proud mother of three boys (at one time all 3 of them were under 2 years old) and they have inspired her to launch Mamalu Kitchen less than 4 months after her twins were born.",
